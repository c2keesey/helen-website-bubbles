The landing page header
Says “Helen Johnston” at the top in bubble metallic letters
This is the font I am trying to use for the header:




Underneath it says “Resume, Projects, Photography, Social” .
Choose a font that will aesthetically go with the header and follows design principles 

Main Page 
The main content of the landing page, underneath the header (described above) are Soap bubbles that are floating from the bottom, up. The Soap bubbles slowly float upward, zigzagging a bit. 
Each Soap bubble should look like this with minor variations so they all look unique:

Once a Soap bubble hits the header, it should disappear. 
Each Soap bubble has individual text written on it written in the same metallic bubble font as the header, but smaller text.
The first bubble says “Resume”, the next “Projects”, then “Photography”, then “Social”, then "Surprise Me”.
 Once a user clicks on the bubble, the bubble will “pop” and take the user to the appropriate page.
The bubbles should appear in the same order as described above once the “Surprise Me” bubble has passed. 
Leave 3 seconds in between each bubble appearing on the page. They should take about 15 seconds to float to the top.
The background is a blue sky, and the overall vibe is a bright, sunny day.
The text on these bubbles should follow the same 
Resume
